------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current (conservative)    128      4              19.1%           2.9%        Very Low
Dense long-range          128      2              12.8%           1.9%        Very Low
Balanced                  96       4              29.7%           4.5%             Low
Balanced aggressive       96       6              32.9%           4.9%             Low
Aggressive                80       4              35.8%           5.4%          Medium
Aggressive sparse         80       6              39.8%           6.0%          Medium
Maximum local             64       4              42.6%           6.4%          Medium
Maximum sparsity          64       8              49.6%           7.4%          Medium

Recommendations:

For Maximum Speed (accept 3-5% quality loss):
   window_size=64, dilation=8

For Balanced Performance (1-3% quality loss):
   window_size=96, dilation=4

For Conservative Approach (<1% quality loss):
   window_size=128, dilation=2

Recommended Next Test:
   window_size=96, dilation=4
   Expected: 8-12% speedup with minimal quality impact
